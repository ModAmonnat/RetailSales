# SpenMart-Retail-Sales-Portfolio
## Project Background
SpenMart is a retail enterprise specializing in the sale and repair of small electronics. The company operates through both physical storefronts and an online store. Historically, SpenMart’s data has been underutilized; reports were inconsistent, ERP inventory levels frequently mismatched physical stock, and customer insights were siloed across fragmented spreadsheets, PDFs, and disconnected databases. To address these challenges, SpenMart has engaged a team of Data and Business Analysts to improve operational efficiency and sales performance. 


Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
- Inventory Accuracy Analysis: Evaluation of inventory physical count data against the inventory count in the ERP system.
- Revenue Contribution by Products: An analysis of which SpenMart products drive the most revenue.
- Customer Valuation: An analysis of customers who contribute the top sales.
- Regional Analysis: An evaluation of sales and orders by region.
- Opportunity Analysis: An analysis of product growth opportunities by correlating customer ratings with sales performance data by product.

## Key Findings
### Inventory System: 
Of 301 products, 39 showed mismatches (87% accuracy). Physical counts were 
higher for 22 items, while system records were higher for 17. Missing manual entries caused 11 errors. 
The total variance of -443,998 was primarily due to Product ID 10092 (an internal SSD): the system listed 
44 units, but the physical count showed 444,444, creating a 444,400 discrepancy. Another manual error 
recorded a 39-unit item as 3.9.
### Top 3 Revenue Products by Sales: 
- Home Theatre($2,023.51)
- Noise Meter(2,005.48)
- Smart Plug(1,859.60)

### Top 3 High-Value Purchase Customers:
High-value customers purchase is evaluated based on their total spending in dollars
- Findlay($2,268.02)
- Joell ($2,174.83)
- Rebecca ($2089.09)

### The top five revenue-generating states:
Florida, California, Ohio, Texas, and New York, representing 411 orders and $86,836.78, equaling 44% of the total revenue. On the other hand, 
Wisconsin, Hawaii, Connecticut, Oklahoma, and North Dakota representing only 23 orders and $4,378.

### Revenue Performance by Product Rating Tier:
The 3-star rated products drive the highest revenue with $87,817, followed by 
$42,557 for 4-star rated products and $38,573 for 5-star rated products.

## Recommendations
Based on the uncover insights, the following recommendations have been provided for specific areas:

### IT-Focused: 
To standardize the process, introduce a physical counting rule with required fields and numeric-only inputs, and implement mandatory field validation to prevent missing values. This should be paired with staff training on the physical count inventory system to ensure accuracy and consistency in data-entry practices. On the technical side, integrate automated discrepancy flags into the ERP system to catch differences easily and quickly, and adopt barcode scanners or mobile inventory tools to reduce manual-entry errors.
### Marketing-Focused:
Develop targeted product lines for tech-creative, health-conscious, and productivity-focused segments while implementing a loyalty program with personalized recommendations. Doing so will increase customer retention, drive higher repeat purchase rates, and grow the average order value from both mass-market and high-value segments.
### Operations-Focused: 
Negotiate volume discounts with suppliers for the top-selling items to maintain competitive pricing, while monitoring safety stock levels for the top three products to 
prevent stockouts. By doing so, the company can reduce procurement costs, protect profit margins, and ensure product availability for high-demand items.
### Location-Strategy: 
Scaling down in these states may include reducing stock for low-demand items, simplifying the product mix to essentials only, and using low-cost, online-focused 
marketing instead of large campaigns. On the other hand, scaling up should include increasing inventory for popular products in these regions, targeted marketing for smart-home and 
entertainment items, and strengthening promotions for repeat customers. These states show the highest engagement and spending; expanding operations here will help SpenMart maximize 
revenue and support future growth.
### Strategic Sourcing Initiative:
Switch vendors for the 3-star rated products to improve quality for items such as smartwatches, game consoles, and power banks, and negotiate volume discounts to maintain competitive pricing.
