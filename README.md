# SpenMart-Retail-Sales-Portfolio
## Project Background
SpenMart is a retail enterprise specializing in the sale and repair of small electronics. The company operates through both physical storefronts and an online store. Historically, SpenMart’s data has been underutilized; reports were inconsistent, ERP inventory levels frequently mismatched physical stock, and customer insights were siloed across fragmented spreadsheets, PDFs, and disconnected databases. To address these challenges, SpenMart has engaged a team of Data and Business Analysts to improve operational efficiency and sales performance. 


Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
- Inventory Accuracy Analysis: Evaluation of inventory physical count data against the inventory count in the ERP system.
- Revenue Contribution by Products: An analysis of which SpenMart products drive the most revenue.
- Customer Valuation: An analysis of customers who contribute the top sales.
- Regional Analysis: An evaluation of sales and orders by region.
- Opportunity Analysis: An analysis of product growth opportunities by correlating customer ratings with sales performance data by product.

## Key Findings
### Inventory System: 
Of 301 products, 39 showed mismatches (87% accuracy). Physical counts were 
higher for 22 items, while system records were higher for 17. Missing manual entries caused 11 errors. 
The total variance of -443,998 was primarily due to Product ID 10092 (an internal SSD): the system listed 
44 units, but the physical count showed 444,444, creating a 444,400 discrepancy. Another manual error 
recorded a 39-unit item as 3.9.


SpenMart maintains a solid operational foundation with an 87% inventory accuracy rate. However, the identification of significant manual entry errors, in SSD stock, highlights a critical need for enhanced data integrity protocols. While Home Theatre systems and high-value clients serve as primary revenue anchors, the company’s geographic footprint is highly concentrated, with only five states generating 44% of total revenue. A notable strategic opportunity lies in the $87,817 generated by 3-star rated products. By implementing targeted quality improvements to elevate these high-volume items to 4 or 5-star status, SpenMart can optimize its product mix to secure untapped profitability and strengthen long-term customer loyalty.
